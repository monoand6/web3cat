**Meow, fellow researcher!**

Web3cat is a framework for fetching and analyzing blockchain data.

Currently, it supports only EVM chains: `Ethereum <https://ethereum.org>`_,
`Polygon <https://polygon.technology>`_, `BNB <https://www.bnbchain.org>`_, etc.

Design philosophy
-----------------

#. Visualize the data with minimum code
#. Free for downloading, saving, and analyzing the data however you want
#. Cache the data to avoid re-fetching anything at all
#. Fully decentralized, that is, depending only on the blockchain RPC
