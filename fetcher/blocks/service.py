    Grid steps

    Note that by default, these timestamps are not 100% accurate.
    Why's that?

    Consider the primary use case for this function: providing timestamps
    for events. Fetching a block for every event might demand
    a fair amount of rpc calls.

    That's why the following algorithm is proposed:

        1. We make a block number grid with a width specified by the ``grid_step`` parameter.
        2. For each block number, we take the two closest grid blocks (below and above).
        3. Fetch the grid blocks
        4. Assume :math:`a_n` and :math:`a_t` is a number and a timestamp for the block above
        5. Assume :math:`b_n` and :math:`b_t` is a number and a timestamp for the block below
        6. Assume :math:`c_n` and :math:`c_t` is a number and a timestamp for the block we're looking for
        7. :math:`w = (c_n - b_n) / (a_n - b_n)`
        8. Then :math:`c_t = b_t \cdot (1-w) + a_t * w`

    This algorithm gives a reasonably good approximation for the block
    timestamp and considerably reduces the number of fetches.
    For example, if we have 500 events happening in the 1000 - 2000
    block range, then we fetch only two blocks instead of 500.

    If you still want the exact precision, use
    ``grid_step = 0``.

    Warning:
        It's highly advisable to use a single ``grid_step`` for all data.
        Otherwise (in theory) the happens-before relationship might
        be violated for the data points.
